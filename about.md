Hey! I'm Aditi, a computer science undergraduate, also a lover of all things literary! This blog will be witness to my sudden bursts of creativity, random flashes of inspiration, uncalled for rants and my innermost thoughts.   
It's where I will - true to the description - muse and vent, enigmatic yet verbose.      
Feel free to engage in a dialogue about the posts you see here. Nothing gladdens my soul more than meeting a kindred spirit!
